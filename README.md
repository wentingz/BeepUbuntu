# Bleep

An Android app that automatically bleeps the censored words for you in your recordings. You can add or delete words that need to be censored to customize your list. You can also share your recordings with your friends!

## Add and Delete Cencored Words

You can customize the censored words list by input your own words, or delete the existing words.
